PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Despite increasing awareness, a large number of users continue to rely on simple passwords due to convenience, lack of knowledge, or poor security habits. This creates significant vulnerabilities across personal, academic, and organizational systems. The problem becomes more critical because users often do not have an immediate way to evaluate the strength of their passwords or identify which elements are missing—such as length, digits, uppercase/lowercase letters, or special characters. Without clear feedback, they unknowingly continue using passwords that can be cracked within seconds. This project aims to address this issue by providing a simple yet effective Python-based tool that analyzes password strength and gives instant, actionable feedback. It helps users understand the weaknesses in their passwords and encourages the creation of secure and robust credentials, ultimately promoting better cybersecurity practices.This project solves that problem by evaluating the strength of passwords and guiding users to create more secure ones.
